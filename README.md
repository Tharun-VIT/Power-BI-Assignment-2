# Power-BI-Assignment-2

### 1. Explain the advantages of Natural Queries in PowerBi with an example?

- It requires no prior knowledge on any querying language like SQL, excel. Querying is carried out using common and natual English language.
- Once dashboard is created and submitted to Business stakeholders, stakeholders find it easy to query on their own in the report submitted by the Analyst Team.
- Power BI shows predictions as user types the query which indeed helps user to query faster and confidently
- It reduces confusion to layman

for example, we may query **"show total sales country wise"**. Power BI understands the query as we type. When we type "show" it lists all the features available. The respected query results are displayed to user/Business stakeholders.
